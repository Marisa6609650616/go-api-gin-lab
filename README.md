# Gin Lab
This project is an individual assignment to extend the REST API functionality from Lab 3. It focuses on implementing full CRUD operations, layered architecture, and robust input validation.

## Objectives
- Implement **PUT** and **DELETE** endpoints.
- Apply **Layered Architecture**.
- Integrate **SQLite** database.
- Implement **Input Validation**.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Install dependencies**:
   `go mod tidy`
3. **Run the server**:
   `go run main.go`

>[!NOTE]
The server will start at http://localhost:8080. The students.db file will be created automatically on the first run.
